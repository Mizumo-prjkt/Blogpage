A short reflection (150-200 words) on how you applied graphic design principles.

I came up with the simplistic design for the UI/UX to show ease of navigation and ease of use on a product
I used a color scheme that is easy on the eyes and not too overwhelming
And lastly, I used a simple font that is easy to read using Impact (presumably)
